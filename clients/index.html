    <h1>Using an IRC Client</h1>
    <p>Using your own IRC client is a great way to experience the wonders of
        Desert Bus Chat while still feeling right at home in your own IRC
        client.  Unless you're new to IRC clients and downloading one for this
        purpose, in which case... Actually, we've got you covered, too.</p>
    <p>You should find detailed instructions specific to your IRC client below.
        (<a href="#tips">"Why? I already know how to do everything!  Just give
        me the information I need!"</a>)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="jircs.html">jIRCs Web Client</a> <strong>[EASY MODE]</strong></li>
        <li><a href="hexchat.html">HexChat</a></li>
        <li><a href="kvirc.html">KVIrc</a></li>

    </ul>
    <p>If your IRC client isn't on the list, nobody created this documentation
        for it!  Hopefully you already know your way around or can figure out
        how to do the things in the Tips section below.</p>
    <h2 id="tips">Information And Tips</h2>
    <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
    <p class="setupdata"><span class="dataheader">Network:</span> <span class="data">irc.desertbus.org</span></p>
    <p class="setupdata"><span class="dataheader">Port:</span> <span class="data">6667</span></p>
    <p class="setupdata"><span class="dataheader">SSL Port:</span> <span class="data">6697</span></p>
    <h3>Autoidentify To Your Donor Account</h3>
    <p>We provide three methods of automatically identifying to NickServ.</p>
    <h4>SASL Authentication</h4>
    <p>SASL Authentication is a secure way to authenticate, and it's one of the
        easiest to set up if your client supports it.  You'll use the email
        address linked to your donor account as your username, and your donor
        account password is your password.</p>
    <h4>Autoidentify to NickServ</h4>
    <p>Most clients provide a password box to fill in your NickServ password,
        which is used to send your password to NickServ automatically when you
        connect to the network.  Unfortunately, just your password is not enough
        to identify you in our unique system.  You may fill in your password in
        this box in one of two ways:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="data">email@address.com:password</span> with a colon between the
                email address and the password</li>
            <li><span class="data">email@address.com password</span> with a space between the
                email address and the password</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Autoidentify With The Server Password</h4>
    <p>Some people prefer to identify using the server password on connect
        because it activates immediately rather than having to wait for NickServ
        to respond (not that NickServ is slow, though).  Either of the formats
        given above that can be placed in the NickServ identify box can be
        placed in the server password box instead.  Just make sure not to do
        both.</p>
